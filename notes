Redis server for cache
Redis module to connect app to Redis server

Installing Redis on Windows is surprisingly easy!

Here's how to do it:

Go to the releases page of the Redis for Windows repo: https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases
Download the 'Redis-x64-xxx.zip' file.  You can use any version.  Make sure you do not download the 'source code' zip.
Unzip the file
In the newly created folder, run redis-server.exe 
You should see a window appear that says redis is running on port 6379.  
Thats it!  Onwards we go!

client.flushall() -> clean redis data

client.hset('1', 'red', 'EX',5); -> addind experation time to 5s -> doesnt work in Windows

puppeteer -> headless browser 
jest -> test runner

keygrip -> to sign sessionid and verify sessionids
cookie-sessions -> for cookie managment

test.only -> will only run that test

travis for CI
